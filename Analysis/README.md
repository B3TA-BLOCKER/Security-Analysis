---

**This audit report assesses the IT infrastructure and security practices of various enterprises based on the provided dataset. The evaluation encompasses a range of parameters, including license compliance, vulnerability management, disaster recovery planning, authentication protocols, access controls, and regulatory compliance.**

---

**`1. License Compliance:`**
- Only 60% of the surveyed enterprises reported having current licenses for all applications and software.
- Non-compliance with licensing agreements can lead to legal and financial repercussions.

**`2. Vulnerability Management:`**
- While 80% of enterprises have controls in place to disclose vulnerabilities in software, only 60% perform vulnerability scans on a regular basis.
- Continuous vulnerability assessment is crucial for identifying and mitigating potential security risks.

**`3. Disaster Recovery Planning:`**
- Most enterprises (80%) have IT continuity and disaster recovery plans in place, with varying frequencies of activation.
- However, 20% reported not having triggered their DRP at all during the year, which may indicate insufficient testing or readiness.

**`4. Cloud Infrastructure:`**
- A majority of enterprises (60%) rely on multiple cloud providers for critical business processes.
- Effective management of multi-cloud environments is essential to ensure resilience and data security.

**`5. Patch Management:`**
- The average time taken to implement critical patches varies widely among enterprises, ranging from immediate to several hours.
- Timely patching is crucial to address known vulnerabilities and minimize the risk of exploitation.

**`6. Secure Development Practices:`**
- While most enterprises (80%) provide SDLC security training to developers, only 60% ensure adherence to OWASP Top 10 practices.
- Secure coding practices are vital to prevent common web application vulnerabilities.

**`7. Access Control and Authentication:`**
- Most enterprises (80%) enforce authentication for user credentials with different authorization levels.
- However, only 60% adhere to the principle of least privilege when granting administrative access.

**`8. Regulatory Compliance:`**
- The majority of enterprises (80%) claim compliance with applicable standards, legal, and regulatory requirements.
- Non-compliance may result in legal penalties and damage to the organization's reputation.

**`9. Incident Response and Logging:`**
- While all enterprises have documented incident response procedures, only 60% have a formal communication procedure for affected parties.
- Effective incident response and communication are essential for minimizing the impact of security incidents.

**`10. Information Security Controls:`**
- Most enterprises have established security controls for infrastructure, access management, cryptography, and separation of environments.
- However, adherence to these controls varies, indicating room for improvement in some areas.

**`Conclusion:`**
Overall, the audit highlights both strengths and areas for improvement in the IT infrastructure and security practices of the surveyed enterprises. Key recommendations include enhancing license compliance, increasing the frequency of vulnerability scans, improving disaster recovery preparedness, and ensuring consistent adherence to security policies and procedures. By addressing these recommendations, enterprises can strengthen their resilience to cyber threats and regulatory compliance posture.
